The VPython project 

Brief game description: 
Our goal is to create a Vpython game based on pool. The game wil start with a 
normal pool setup. Then players will take turns hitting the que ball, trying to 
get either stripes or solids in. So far, you can change the direction the que is 
going in by changing your view with the double click. You can make the ball move 
using arrow keys.

How has the game evolved:
The game now has working pockets that take the balls and deposit them under 
the table. If the white ball goes under you can press the space bar and it 
returns to its original position. The white ball now moves according to your view 
and the arrow keys.
