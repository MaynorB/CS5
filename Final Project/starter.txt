vPython Pool Final Project

Group Members: Eduardo A, Maynor B, Imani however

Vision: We plan to replicate pool in vPython creating assets like the balls, table, and the pits the balls fall in. 
We also plan to implement collisions with every ball and the table. 
After this, we'll have a player interface that let's a player control the strength and direction of their hit. 
Then, we'll have all the game rules (e.g. Not hitting the 8-ball last results in a loss) and if time permits, a menu for the game.

Current Changes: As of now, we've gotten a lot of progress done. 
We've completed the assets and pretty much all the collisions. We have 16 assets interacting with each other and the walls.
