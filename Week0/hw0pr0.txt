I find it surprising how one uses cardinal lamguage to describe direction. 
I could never, but I do see how it can clear up confusion when informing  others where an object could be.
Since cardinal directions do not change, saying something is north is better than left cause then you do not have to rely on where the other is looking towards.
Now having a compass in your head 24/7, i could never. Too many things enter and leave my mind.
