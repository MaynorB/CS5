"So theory isn’t dead, yet, but it is changing – perhaps beyond recognition."    True?   False?   Other?
I believe it to be ture.
As humans are slowly not being actively involved with testing and testing, rather a computer running possible simulations, theorizing as it once was is fading away.
ALthough it would be awhile before it is fully changed.
The world, this universe still has plenty for traditionalk theorizing.
We do not need a computer for everything yet.
