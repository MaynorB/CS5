Perhaps you find compelling the argument that the human user of the AI-system is the author of the novel works (or novels!)
Perhaps you find compelling that these new tools require different "authorship boundaries" than their predecessors?
Or, perhaps this family of cabilities will - or should - alter the role of author more fundamentally than side-taking...

I bel8eve authroship is something you came up with. 
Letting a comput5er do it for you makes the work belong to the computer, you just told it how to do it.
Yes you can state you made the program, but that program made the art.
We either accept that computers can have authorships or we have to change our views of authorship.
