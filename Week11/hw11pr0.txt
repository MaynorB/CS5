The net effect of the gain in computer skill is thus, ironically, a gain in human skill.
 Humans—at least the best ones—are getting better at playing chess. Reflect on other areas—in the past or in the future—in 
 which you imagine computers have made or will make humans better at something that has traditionally been a characteristically human strength.

 Construction could be one. Pure human strength is great, but machines and programs can rival consturction workers.
 This can motivate construction workers to push their limits, find other ways they can help out on a construction project.
 Humans can both be an extra hand and repair the machines when they break down.
