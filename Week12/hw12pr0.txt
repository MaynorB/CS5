One quote from the article: "Aristotle [... drew ... ] a distinction between what he called “actual” infinity, 
something that would exist all at once, at a given moment—which he declared an impossibility—and “potential” infinity, 
which would unfold over time and which he deemed perfectly intelligible." 
Reflect on how this Aristotelian distinction does (or doesn't) capture the difference between the 
infinity of mathematical functions and the infinity of computer programs.

I believe it does capture the infinity of computer programs.
Computer programs can do anything, they just have to be made.
It demostrates the potential infinisty of computer programs.
As for the infinity of mathematical functions, the potential applies as well.
It takes time for those to unfold, although pi and e do natrually exist all at one.
I believe pi and e to be the exception to an "actual" infinity as they exist all at once.
