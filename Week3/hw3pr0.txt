Are we actually in a simulation? Yes? No? Maybe...? Why do you think so (or not)?:

I do not think so. 
Emotions can not relly be replicated, pain can be simulated but the sadness can't.
It would take a different type of technology to replicate feelings.
plus a heart beat, the soul within us, that can't be just created with technolgy.
A soul is more natrual than artifical.
