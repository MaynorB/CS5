Which contributing factor within the bug's origins (there are many!) strikes you as the "most preventable" and why? 
Of course, this will be in hindsightâ€¦.
The investigative report that uncovered the bug stated that software "does not fail in the same sense as a mechanical system." 
Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Explain briefly.

I believe the calculation should never had stayed on for the first 40 seconds of flight. 
It was suelfess and served no real purpose besides being "a "special feature" meant to make it easy to restart the system in the event of a brief hold in the countdown".
I agree that software doesn't fail in the same sense as a mechanical system.
Usually when a mechanical system fails, it was eigheher built srong or the calculations were off material wise.
Software involved calculations, both types of failure share it, but it can also rely on the speed of the computer, the edition or the particular language.
I also agree that software is like an orgasm, bulding upon previous lines of code and knowledge.
