Since the growth is exponetial, we can use 2**n, whatever n will be.
For 100qubits, it would be 2**100 = 1.2676506e+30 numbers. 
For 280 qubits, it would be 1.9426689e+84 numbers.
I like David Bacon's tweet as it forces you to think a bit beyond universes existing with each others.
It is still a bit hard to wrap my head around it.
