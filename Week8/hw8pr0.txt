This article distinguishes between algorithms and authors, e.g., often, algorithms and online results simply reflect people's attitudes and behavior.
To what extent do you agree that algorithms are (or aren't) subjective as a judge of human beings?

I believe that algorithms reflect roughly 89% of human being's attidudes and behaviors.
Humans when coding up the algorithm can not be 100% unbiased as huamns natrually insert their views. 
Due to this, the algorithm will have a small part that is influenced by the programmer.
As the algortihm can not really decide what is right on its own, it is limited to what the programmer told it what is right.
Of course, it can learn and begin moving away from what it was taught from the programmer.
