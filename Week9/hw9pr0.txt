How willing you, personally, would be to live in that envisioned scenario?
How willing you feel society as a whole would be to experience that envisioned scenario?

I would be very willing.
My main reason being that I don't have to worry much and can rely on the car to dive itself.
The added pro of less accidents also is appealing.
Society would not be as willing as driverless cars is a massive change.
There will be people who will not change as they rather rely on themselves.
